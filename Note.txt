TOPIC: Authentication in IoT

========================== Constrain ==========================
Limited resource
- Power
- Other resource (Memory?)

========================== Scope ==========================
1/ Specific context?
- In traffic
- In hospital?
* Protocol to authenticate which keeps privacy.

========================== Keywords ==========================
- A Lightweight Authentication and Encryption Protocol for Secure Communications Between Resource-Limited Devices Without Hardware Modification:
  Resource-Limited Device Authentication
    + Lightweight Authentication and Encryption protocol
    + Cryptography
    + HW IoT sensors?
    + HP plus?
    + Authentication for Resource-Limited Device
    + Resource-constrained Devices
    + Keep privacy
    + IoT
    + Hashing function
- Zero knowledge?
- Main Keywords: Authentication, Resource-Limited, Privacy

========================== Considerations ==========================
- Case of being attacked?

Main Keywords: Authentication, Resource-Limited, Privacy
IoT - Authentication in IoT with privacy
	Assume that there is no problem in network, all information is kept the same.
	Privacy: people provide information to authenticate, must protect them. (info may be key, biometrics, ...)
Journal ISI: authentication with resource-constrained and keep privacy
